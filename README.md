# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of Analysis 
Bobby's manager has tasked the team with determining the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program using SQL. 
## Results 

The results show that there are around 72,000 positions that might need to be filled due to employees retiring. Despite this substantial number, there should be enough employees to train the next generation.

## Summary 
There are approximately 72,458 roles that may need to be filled due to the number of soon-to-retire employees. Despite that, there should still be enough employees to train the next generation assuming those that are retiring leave in a staggered period. Two additional queries that could aid the analysis are determining the timeframe in which retiring employees plan to leave and relaxing the requirements of the mentorship program to include a larger group of eligible employees.
